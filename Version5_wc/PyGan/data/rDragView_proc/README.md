# DragView

`DragView` aims to help with the visualisation of DRAGON/DONJON output using the ParaView software. While it currently only works for the SN type calculation for 2D and 3D Cartesian or hexagonal geometries, it is hoped that this is flexible enough that other types of geometries and calculations can be added. 

### Visualisation with ParaView

ParaView can be downloaded at the following [link](https://www.paraview.org/download/). Once installed, click on 
```
File -> Open
```
and navigate to the folder containing the vtu files. Select the desired file and _*click on 'Apply'*_ (usually found in the left panel in the 'Properties' tab). 

There are countless visualisation (e.g. clip, slice, extract) and data manipulation options available natively in ParaView, and the [wiki](https://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView) is a good place to start.
