SUMMARY

\end{center}

This technical report contains the logical contents of the data structures used by the reactor physics codes DRAGON and TRIVAC Version5. These data structures are basically memory-resident associative tables that may contain inner structures made of associative tables and/or heterogeneous lists. These data structures are implemented using the LCM/XSM application programming interface (API) described in the Ganlib5 kernel guide (IGE-332).\cite{Ganlib5}
