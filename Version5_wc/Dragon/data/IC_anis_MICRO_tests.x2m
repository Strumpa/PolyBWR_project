*** CLE-2000 script meant test IC implementation
* Geometries generated by GLOW and GEO: are compared
* in AT10 cases, it was noticed that Gd presence induces increase in IC vs MOC difference
* This series of tests aims to check the influence of Gd positioning in lattices. 
* All tests are 3x3 lattices with UOX cells, apart from 1 Gd cell placed in different positions
* Tests performed using pre-computed 1-group macroscopic cross sections.
